Feature: Send data to the cloud
  As a city
  I want to know the light situation on the streets
  In order to selectively turn street lamps on or off

Scenario Outline: Forward the sensor data to the cloud
  Given I have a DBus streetlight
  And the brightness is <brightness>
  And the moisture is <moisture>
  And I connect to the local mqtt broker
  And I start streetlightd

  When I tell streetlightd to update

  Then I expect one mqtt message with the content:
    """
    brightness <brightness>
    moisture <moisture>

    """

  Examples:
    | brightness | moisture |
    | 0          | 0.3      |
    | 0.42       | 0        |
    | 0.57       | 0.9      |
    | 1          | 0.14     |
